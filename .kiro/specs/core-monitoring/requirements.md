# Requirements Document
## Core Storage Monitoring System

### Introduction

This specification defines the core monitoring functionality for the Kubernetes TrueNAS Democratic Tool. The system provides comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities for OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters using TrueNAS Scale storage via democratic-csi, focusing on orphaned resource detection, snapshot management, and configuration validation.

### Requirements

#### Requirement 1: Orphaned Resource Detection

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to automatically detect orphaned storage resources across Kubernetes and TrueNAS systems, so that I can reclaim unused storage and reduce costs.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL identify PersistentVolumes without corresponding TrueNAS volumes
2. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL identify TrueNAS volumes without corresponding Kubernetes PersistentVolumes  
3. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL identify PersistentVolumeClaims unbound for longer than the configured threshold
4. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL identify VolumeSnapshots without corresponding TrueNAS snapshots
5. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL identify TrueNAS snapshots without corresponding VolumeSnapshot objects
6. WHEN the system scans for orphaned resources THEN it SHALL complete the scan within 5 minutes for 1000 volumes
7. WHEN the system identifies orphaned resources THEN it SHALL achieve >99.9% detection accuracy with zero false positives for active resources

#### Requirement 2: Real-time Monitoring Service

**User Story:** As a storage administrator, I want continuous monitoring of the storage infrastructure, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact applications.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monitoring service starts THEN it SHALL establish connections to both Kubernetes API and TrueNAS API
2. WHEN the monitoring service is running THEN it SHALL perform scans at configurable intervals (default 5 minutes)
3. WHEN the monitoring service detects changes THEN it SHALL update metrics within 1 minute
4. WHEN the monitoring service encounters errors THEN it SHALL log detailed error information without exposing credentials
5. WHEN the monitoring service is stopped THEN it SHALL gracefully shutdown within 30 seconds
6. WHEN the monitoring service exports metrics THEN it SHALL provide Prometheus-compatible metrics on /metrics endpoint

#### Requirement 3: Storage Usage Analytics

**User Story:** As a storage administrator, I want detailed analytics on storage usage and thin provisioning efficiency, so that I can optimize storage allocation and plan capacity.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL calculate total allocated vs actual used storage
2. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL track thin provisioning efficiency ratios
3. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL monitor pool overcommitment levels
4. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL identify volumes approaching capacity limits
5. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL provide accuracy within 1% of actual usage
6. WHEN the system analyzes storage usage THEN it SHALL maintain historical trending data for 90+ days

#### Requirement 4: Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want automated validation of storage configuration across all systems, so that I can ensure proper setup and prevent configuration drift.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL verify StorageClass parameters match TrueNAS capabilities
2. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL check CSI driver health across all nodes
3. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL verify RBAC permissions completeness
4. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL validate VolumeSnapshotClass configurations
5. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL ensure retention policy alignment between systems
6. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL complete validation runs within 30 seconds
7. WHEN the system validates configuration THEN it SHALL provide clear remediation steps for each identified issue

#### Requirement 5: API and CLI Interface

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want both programmatic API access and command-line tools, so that I can integrate monitoring into existing workflows and perform ad-hoc queries.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API server starts THEN it SHALL provide REST endpoints for all monitoring functions
2. WHEN the API server receives requests THEN it SHALL respond within 500ms for standard queries
3. WHEN the API server receives requests THEN it SHALL authenticate and authorize all requests
4. WHEN the CLI tool is invoked THEN it SHALL provide intuitive commands for all monitoring functions
5. WHEN the CLI tool is invoked THEN it SHALL support multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML)
6. WHEN the CLI tool is invoked THEN it SHALL complete commands within 10 seconds
7. WHEN the CLI tool is invoked THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive help and shell completion

#### Requirement 6: Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the monitoring system to follow security best practices and provide audit capabilities, so that I can ensure compliance and maintain system security.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system handles credentials THEN it SHALL never log or expose credentials in plain text
2. WHEN the system communicates externally THEN it SHALL use TLS 1.3+ for all connections
3. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL follow principle of least privilege for RBAC permissions
4. WHEN the system performs operations THEN it SHALL log all actions with complete audit trail
5. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support external secret managers (Vault, Sealed Secrets)
6. WHEN the system rotates secrets THEN it SHALL support automatic credential rotation
7. WHEN the system undergoes security audit THEN it SHALL pass with zero critical findings

#### Requirement 7: High Availability and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the monitoring system to be highly available and performant, so that it can reliably monitor large-scale storage infrastructure.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling of API components
2. WHEN the system monitors resources THEN it SHALL handle 10,000+ volumes without performance degradation
3. WHEN the system processes metrics THEN it SHALL handle 1M+ metrics per minute
4. WHEN the system uses resources THEN it SHALL maintain minimal footprint (<500MB RAM base)
5. WHEN the system components fail THEN it SHALL provide automatic failover capabilities
6. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% API availability
7. WHEN the system scales THEN it SHALL support leader election for monitor services

#### Requirement 8: Integration and Notifications

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want the monitoring system to integrate with existing alerting and notification systems, so that I can receive timely notifications about storage issues.

##### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects issues THEN it SHALL send notifications via configured channels (Slack, Teams, email)
2. WHEN the system sends notifications THEN it SHALL deliver them within 30 seconds of detection
3. WHEN the system sends notifications THEN it SHALL support severity-based routing
4. WHEN the system sends notifications THEN it SHALL support notification templates and customization
5. WHEN the system integrates with external systems THEN it SHALL support custom webhooks
6. WHEN the system escalates issues THEN it SHALL support escalation policy workflows
7. WHEN the system exports metrics THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with Prometheus/Grafana stacks
