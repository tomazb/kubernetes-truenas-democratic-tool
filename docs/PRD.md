# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Kubernetes TrueNAS Democratic Tool

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
A comprehensive monitoring and management tool that bridges the gap between OpenShift/Kubernetes, TrueNAS Scale, and democratic-csi, providing organizations with real-time visibility, automated issue detection, and actionable insights for their persistent storage infrastructure.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Organizations using OpenShift/Kubernetes with TrueNAS Scale storage via democratic-csi face significant operational challenges:
- No unified view across the three systems
- Manual detection of orphaned resources wastes storage and money

- No automated compliance checking for storage best practices

### 1.3 Solution Overview
An open-source, security-first tool that:
- Continuously monitors the entire storage stack
- Automatically detects and reports configuration issues
- Identifies orphaned resources across all systems
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Enables automated remediation workflows
- Delivers enterprise-grade security and compliance
